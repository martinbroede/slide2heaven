# slide2heaven

A quick and dirty script that converts HTML documents to a PowerPoint-like presentation in your internet browser. I usually convert .md files with the VS Code extension Markdown All in One to HTML.

A markdown # Title (or a corresponding h1 HTML tag) will trigger a new slide. You can use directives like:

%half

some content

%nexthalf

some more content

%endhalf

to split up the slides into horizontally arranged blocks.

If this script turns out to be useful for you, feel free to contact me, and I will provide more information on how to use directives, in case you need it.
